How to use xrowvideo:

1. Add the extension. Activate it in site.ini. You need the ezjscore extension.

2. Add this datatype to your favorite class.

3. Make sure that the user who will work with this datatype have policy to ezjscore call

4. Install the cronjob:
# php runcronjobs.php -s admin convertmedia
